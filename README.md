# Regression Analysis on Infant Mortality

## Overview
This repository contains a regression analysis focused on modeling infant mortality using various predictors, including fertility, agriculture, and education. The analysis addresses normality, outliers, and skewness in the data, leading to the development of a regression model that can be improved through various techniques.

## Key Insights
- Regression modeling of infant mortality with multiple predictors.
- Examination of normality, outliers, and skewness in data.
- Strategies to improve model performance and accuracy.

## Files in this Repository
- `Regression_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the regression analysis.
- `Regression_Analysis.html`: HTML version of the notebook.
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model tuning in building accurate regression models.
